# Changelog

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix build failure caused by `captureOwnerStack` not being exported in React 19 stable
  - The `captureOwnerStack` API is only available in React's development builds, not in production. This caused build failures for users.
  - Replaced direct import with a safe wrapper function that conditionally accesses the API only in development mode.
  - Updated all dependencies to their latest versions (vitest 4.x, jsdom 27.x, eslint-plugin-react-hooks 7.x, etc.)
  - Fixed rollup config compatibility with updated @rollup/plugin-typescript

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4e1cb62: Add opt-in debug mode for cleaner development experience

  Implements quiet-by-default debugging with opt-in activation via environment variable or component prop. This follows industry standards for library behavior and provides a more professional development experience.

  **New Features:**
  - `debug` prop on ComposableMap component for per-map debugging
  - `REACT_SIMPLE_MAPS_DEBUG` environment variable for global debugging
  - Quiet by default - no console output unless explicitly enabled

  **Breaking Change:**
  - Debug logging is now **disabled by default** (was previously enabled in development)
  - To restore previous behavior, set `REACT_SIMPLE_MAPS_DEBUG=true` or use `debug={true}` prop

  **Benefits:**
  - ✅ Cleaner development console by default
  - ✅ Professional library behavior following React/Next.js conventions
  - ✅ Granular control over debug output
  - ✅ Still provides rich debugging when needed

  **Migration:**
  - No action needed for most users (cleaner experience)
  - To enable debugging: add `debug={true}` prop or set environment variable

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 2d3ce74: Fix React DOM warnings in ZoomableGroup component

  Resolves console warnings about unrecognized DOM props by properly filtering internal ZoomableGroup props before forwarding to DOM elements. This eliminates development warnings while maintaining full functionality and backward compatibility.

  **Fixed warnings:**
  - `minZoom` prop on DOM element
  - `maxZoom` prop on DOM element
  - `scaleExtent` prop on DOM element
  - `enableZoom` prop on DOM element
  - `translateExtent` prop on DOM element
  - `enablePan` prop on DOM element

  **Changes:**
  - Modified ZoomableGroup prop destructuring to extract internal props
  - Added proper ESLint handling for intentionally unused variables
  - Maintained full React 19 compliance and functionality

  **Impact:**
  - ✅ Clean development experience with zero console warnings
  - ✅ No breaking changes or functional impact
  - ✅ Improved React 19 compliance
